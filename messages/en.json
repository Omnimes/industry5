    "p5": "Industry 5.0, based on a strategy that shifts focus from treating people as resources to recognizing them as real assets, adds a new dimension to this approach. Instead of serving organizations, it means that organizations start serving people. Rather than utilizing talents solely for gaining competitive advantage and creating value for customers, Industry 5.0 focuses on adding value for employees to attract and retain the best specialists. Integrating this approach with human-centered organization principles is a key element for success in a dynamic and competitive business environment.",
    "text2": "Resilience",
    "alt_odpornosc": "Illustration depicting 'Resilience - Supply Chain'",
    "p6": "With the globalization of the world, we increasingly recognize the widespread impact of global issues, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and international supply chain shortages. Although many companies strive to improve efficiency and optimize profits, these factors alone do not increase resilience. In fact, there is a belief that focusing solely on efficiency and flexibility may make companies less, rather than more, resilient. Instead of focusing solely on growth, profits, and efficiency, more resilient organizations will aim to anticipate every potential crisis and respond to it to ensure stability in challenging times.",
    "p7": "The value chain model describes the comprehensive actions necessary to develop a product or service - from the conceptual stage, through raw material sourcing, production processes, and marketing activities, to distribution. The value chain-based approach aims to understand the needs of companies and entities within a given industry, such as raw material suppliers, end customers, and entities providing technical, business, and financial support for the industry and business environment. Below are general principles for implementing value chain development programs:",

    "ol_li_res2": "Through the benefits of win-win relationships in stakeholder cooperation, some companies find motivation to change their adopted methods of operation and forms of contact used with other chain participants.

    "ol_li_res4": "The value chain-based approach aims to enable the private sector to act on its own through the modernization of companies and the co-creation of a competitive value chain, thereby contributing to economic growth and poverty reduction.

    "text3": "Sustainable Development",
    "alt_eco": "Illustration depicting 'Sustainable Development - Ecology'",
    "p8": "Industry 5.0 transforms the concept of sustainable development from simply mitigating climate damage to actively seeking positive change. This goal, also referred to as 'net positive', aims to make the world a better place where companies are part of the solution, not the problem. It's not just about declaring sustainable development goals but also about real commitment to them.",
    "p9": "Sustainable development has played a key role in European policy for a long time, finding its place in the European Treaties. The European Union has fully committed to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, consisting of 17 sustainable development goals, established by the UN General Assembly in 2015. The Green Deal, announced in December 2019, sets clear directions for Europe towards a sustainable economy. Several effective tools have been identified to help the EU achieve carbon neutrality goals. Innovations in green technologies, combined with EU initiatives regarding the digitalization of the European industry (such as better use of big data and artificial intelligence), are becoming a reality and are increasingly accepted by the industry. Faced with growing social and environmental concerns, companies are integrating sustainable development into their business models. As industry recognizes the benefits of a better corporate image and savings in energy and material costs, resource efficiency becomes a natural choice.",
    "p10": "Increased industrial production typically entails higher energy consumption and increased carbon dioxide emissions. However, innovations can reverse this trend through smarter production planning and the use of more energy-efficient technologies.",
    "p11": "Since 2005, the net growth in industrial energy efficiency has slowed. Understanding the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth at the sectoral level, especially in energy-intensive industrial sectors, is essential. Such sectoral analysis can help identify industry-specific issues, leading to more targeted research and innovation in energy efficiency, as well as specifically targeted energy policy."

    "titlePart2": "from Industry 1.0 to Industry 5.0",
    "p1": "The history of industry is a fascinating and multifaceted topic that encompasses the development of technology, society, and the economy over the centuries. From the beginnings of handicrafts and manufacturing, through the industrial revolution, to contemporary innovations in automation and sustainable development, industry plays a key role in shaping the world we live in.",
    "p2": "How has manufacturing evolved from the first industrial revolution (Industry 1.0) to the current stage, known as Industry 5.0? Since the late 18th century, when the first industrial revolution began, industry has come a long way and continues to develop dynamically.",
    "p3": "In pre-industrial times, agrarian economies dominated, and the production of goods took place mainly in small craft workshops. Handicrafts and manufacturing were the primary forms of production, and most of the population worked on farms. Technological innovations were relatively rare, and production was limited locally.",
    "p4": "The turn of the 18th and 19th centuries brought the first industrial revolution, which began in Great Britain and quickly spread to other countries in Europe and North America. Key inventions such as James Watt's steam engine, mechanical looms, and the spinning machine revolutionized the production of textiles and other goods. The first factories were established, enabling mass production on an unprecedented scale. The increase in production and efficiency contributed to the dynamic development of cities and the migration of people from rural areas to industrial centers.",
    "p5": "The second industrial revolution, which took place at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, was driven by the development of electricity, chemistry, petroleum, and steel. The invention of the light bulb by Thomas Edison, the development of steel production by the Bessemer process, and the emergence of Henry Ford's production lines revolutionized industry and society. The application of new technologies in transportation, such as railways and automobiles, and the development of communication through the telephone and telegraph contributed to globalization and further economic growth.",
    "p6": "The third industrial revolution, also known as the digital revolution, began in the second half of the 20th century. The key element of this era was the emergence of computers and information technologies. The invention of the transistor, the development of microprocessors, and the internet contributed to the automation of production processes and the creation of a global information network. Industry increasingly relied on advanced technology, leading to the emergence of new economic sectors such as the information, telecommunications, and robotics industries.",
    "p7": "Today, we are witnessing the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0. It is characterized by the integration of digital, physical, and biological technologies. Key innovations include artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, blockchain, 3D printing, and robotics. These technologies are leading to the creation of smart factories where production processes are optimized and automated in ways previously unattainable. Industry 4.0 also changes social and economic relationships, impacting the labor market and requiring new skills from workers.",
    "p8": "The history of industry is also a history of challenges such as environmental pollution, exploitation of natural resources, social inequalities, and climate change. Modern industry faces the task of implementing sustainable production practices and seeking new solutions that will enable harmonious economic development while protecting the natural environment.",
